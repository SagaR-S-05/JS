    IIFE(Immediately Invoked Function Expressions):
    - To invoke the function immediately after declaration.
    - To remove problems caused by global scope pollution i.e., 
    IIFE creates its own function scope, so variables inside it donâ€™t leak into the global scope.
    Syntax:
    (Write your functions here)() -> Here () in the end is your exeution

// For multiple functions. IIFE doesn't know when to end. So we end the previous function with semicolon.
